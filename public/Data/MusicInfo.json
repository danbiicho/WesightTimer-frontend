    "musicDescription": "Using your imagination and visualization, float through the air into a deeply relaxed and free state. This meditation helps by guiding your breath and through the use of a body scan. Relaxing as you listen, you will become lighter in mind and heavier in body. Releasing your anxieties and worries as you relax, eventually sleep should be a mere breath away."
